# RETAIL SALES ANALYSIS USING PYTHON (NUMPY, PANDAS, MATPLOTLIB, SEABORN)

## PROJECT OVERVIEW 
#### This project analyzes a retail sales dataset to reveal trends, customer behavior and the performance of each product. Using Python in Jupyter Notebook environment, I loaded the dataset in, cleaned it and conducted statistical analysis, sales trends and answered business questions relating to customer and product analysis.

##### Gender  
##### Age  
##### Product Category 
##### Quantity 
##### Price per Unit
##### Total Amount             


## TOOLS

##### Python
##### Jupyter Notebook 
##### Numpy 
##### Pandas
##### Seaborn
##### Matplotlib 

## DATA CLEANING AND PREPARATION

##### Checked for duplicates and null values
##### Changed the date to a datetime data instead of being an object 
##### Created new columns to divide the data into day, month and year

## STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
#### The statistical analysis performed are: 
##### Descriptive statistics(mean, median, standard deviation and count)
##### Correlation analysis 
##### Sales distribution analysis

## SALES TREND ANALYSIS

#### The trends were explored using graphics and the questions answered are:

##### Sales by gender distribution
##### Sales by age distribution
##### Purchases per products
##### Monthly sales quantity by gender
##### Sales by month 


## VISUALIZATION

#### The project includes the following visuals, they were created using seaborn and matplotlib:

##### Bar Chart
##### Box Plot
##### Count Plot
##### Histogram

## CUSTOMER AND PRODUCT ANALYSIS

#### For this four business questions were explored and they are:
##### 1. Does customer age and gender influence their purchasing behavior?
##### 2. Are there discernible patterns in sales across different time periods?
##### 3. Which product categories hold the highest appeal among customers?
##### 4. What are the relationships between age, spending, and product preferences?
